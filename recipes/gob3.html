    <h2>How to make Plantain and beans</h2>
    <p>Let me clarify todayâ€™s post for you my lovely readers who have not heard of red red. Red red is simply fried plantains with beans stew. I am guessing the reason for the name is due to the fact that the beans stew is made with palm oil and the plantains are also fried with palm oil. Thus, red red leaves a red hue on plates when served.</p>
